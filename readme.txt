To change the images should be placed within the slider_qm folder that is in the path specified above, 
within this same folder there is a file index.html this is where the name of the image and size you set. 

To change the name of the image we are positioned in line 
<li> <a href="#cubeShow"> <img src="/QvAjaxZfc/QvsViewClient.aspx?public=only&name=Extensions/slider_vw/vitaminwater_1.png" class="cubeShow" /> </ a> </ li > 

1. src --> name of our image. 
2. href --> effect name is assigned, must match the class attribute of the <a> tag. 


If you need to resize our images in the same file index.html on line 25 assign the desired size. 

$ ('. box_skitter_large') css ({width: 940, height: 129}).; 

And in the script.js file in line 9, 10, 19, 20 frame size is changed.

You can assign specific properties to the slideshow, as the interval of time, 
remove the load bar, among other things, the full documentation of this component can be found here:
